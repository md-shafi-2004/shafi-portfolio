## About Me
A curious mind wandering through the realms of technology, I am Shafi, a Computer Science student at the University of South Wales. I actually really enjoy being a handyman — I like to solve problems, and I love learning. I think that from the perspective of my life experiences, all over the world, with a lot of new energy, I felt like some answers to it comes in the least expected ways. I don't want to be someone who knows how to code well, I want to contribute in the creation of technology that makes life easier. Come with me on this journey of expansion, inspiration and discovery.
